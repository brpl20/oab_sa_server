# Autonomous OAB Batch Runner Script for Server Environments
# This script processes lawyer files in batches, managing concurrency and logging.

# --- Configuration ---
# IMPORTANT: Adjust these paths and limits according to your server environment and resources.

# Base path where your input lawyer JSON files are located.
# Example: /home/ubuntu/oab_scraper/data/input
BASE_PATH="/home/ubuntu/oab_scraper/data/input"

# Name of your Python scraping script.
# Make sure this script is in the same directory as this Bash runner script, 
# or provide the full path if it's elsewhere.
PYTHON_SCRIPT="request_lawyers_with_society_retry_errorr_with_delay.py" 

# Path to your Python virtual environment activation script.
# Example: /home/ubuntu/oab_scraper/oabsa_env/bin/activate
VENV_PATH="/home/ubuntu/oab_scraper/oabsa_env/bin/activate" 

# Range of lawyer part files to process lawyers_001.json to lawyers_200.json
START_PART=001
END_PART=025



# Maximum number of Python scraping processes to run concurrently.
# Start with a low number (e.g., 2-5) and increase gradually based on server resources (CPU, RAM)
# and proxy provider limits. 100 concurrent Selenium instances are VERY resource-intensive.
MAX_CONCURRENT_PROCESSES=25 # Recommended to start low. Adjust as needed.

# Delay in seconds between launching new batches, if slots are available.
DELAY_BETWEEN_LAUNCHES=10

# Delay in seconds when waiting for a process slot to become free.
WAIT_FOR_SLOT_DELAY=10
